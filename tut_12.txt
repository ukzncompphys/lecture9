question 1:  For the gaussian initial conditions, the error does go
down with the square of the number of points, as we expected.  

question 2: The minimod limiter does inteed get rid of the
overshooting.  It is not, however, particularly accurate, about
halfway between 1st and 2nd order.  For a gaussian run through 1
period with C=0.5, I find going from 200 to 2000 points gives
[0.044, 0.005] for the 1st order mean error
[5.6e-4, 5.7e-6] for 2nd order mean error, and 
[3.1e-3,4.2e-5] for the minimod limited result.  The minimod is a
definite improvement over the 1st order, with somewhat better
stability than the second order.  Note that in the gaussian plots, the
2nd order solution is sufficiently accurate that it is
indistinguishable from the true solution at the resolution of the plots.
